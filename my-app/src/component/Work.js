                Scheduling with Mr. Handyman is easy. Just one simple phone call hires 
                a seasoned professional who will care for your home like you deserve. You 
                can schedule today by clicking Request Service. Unless special arrangements 
                are made in advance, you should be home during the scheduled appointment. If 
                you prefer an estimate, in most cases we can provide a general price estimate 
                over the phone.

                <p>
                Mr. Handyman arrives at the scheduled appointment time in a clearly marked 
                van with a variety of tools and supplies. You will be assigned a technician 
                skilled in the work to be done. Your technician will be wearing a Mr. Handyman 
                uniform and will review the job with you to confirm the length of time needed and 
                the price to complete the job and then start working on your project.
                Our technicians have an average of 10 years of experience in the trades and 
                are fully insured. If the work to be done requires more than a single handyman, 
                your local Mr. Handyman office will have set the expectation that additional 
                uniformed Mr. Handyman technicians will be sent.

                <p>
                We’re happy to work with whatever materials you supply – paint that you want 
                to be used, kitchen tile or light bulbs that you have purchased. If there are 
                additional materials needed for your job, there are a couple options: 
                Have Mr. Handyman pick up the materials for you for an additional fee. 
                Our technician can begin work on your project while you do the shopping for 
                any additional materials your technician needs to complete the job. When you 
                hire Mr. Handyman, you and your property are protected. Mr. Handyman 
                technicians are fully insured for accidental damage and workers’ compensation. 
                If one of our handymen is injured while performing work in your home or business, 
                you are free of liability.

                Most often, services are billed based on project basis. The benefit you receive is 
                that you only pay for the time required to complete the work. Payment is expected at 
                the completion of work unless other arrangements have been made with the local business 
                office. Our work is backed by our Neighborly Done Right Promise: After we leave your home, 
                if you find a problem with the workmanship performed, simply call the office and we will 
                return to address the problem.
